# Next.js Starter Template

This is a Starter Template for Next.js projects, designed to provide a solid starting point for professional web development. It comes equipped with Typescript, ESLint, Prettier, and TailwindCSS for a powerful, flexible, and efficient modern JavaScript development experience.

## Features

- **Next.js** - The React framework for production - it gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
- **Typescript** - Superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output, offering static type-checking along with latest ECMAScript features.
- **ESLint** - Pluggable JavaScript linter. It is fully configurable, so you can turn off every rule and run only with basic syntax validation.
- **Prettier** - Opinionated Code Formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
- **TailwindCSS** - A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

## Getting Started
